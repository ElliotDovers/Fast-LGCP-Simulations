# Fast-LGCP-Simulations
This repo accompanies the manuscript "Fast, Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Log-Gaussian Cox Processes" published in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics:
[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2023.2182311](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2023.2182311)

This code was used to produce the simulations in Section 4 (and Supplementary Material S2). Note that these simulations predate the creation of the [`scampr`](https://github.com/ElliotDovers/scampr) package - the most up-to-date resource for fitting these types of models (and more!)

Code for analysing the gorilla nesting data within the paper is provided as part of the Supplementary Materials.
