# Fast-IDM-Code
This repo accompanies the manuscript "Fast methods for fitting species distribution models
from integrated data" published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution:\
[https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14252](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14252)\
The code can be used to replicate both the simulations and real data analyses therein.

## SIMULATION STUDY
Contains the three simulation studies explored in the paper:
- Comparing scampr and INLA
- Effects of data availability and spatial range on the IDM
- Appendix: Replicating the baseline simulations of Simmonds et al., 2020

## APPLICATION TO DATA
Contains `R` scripts to analyse 29 species of Flora from the `disdat` package - see Elith et al., 2020
